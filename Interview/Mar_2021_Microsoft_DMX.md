### Company: Microsoft Research Lab
#### Group: 
##### Data Management Exploration and Mining (DMX): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/
##### Systems Research Group: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-redmond/
#### Position: 

1. SDE - Systems Research Group - Microsoft Research
2. SDE 2 (Ph.D. required)
3. Researcher – Data Platforms and Analytics – Microsoft Research (Ph.D. required) 

#### Why DBMS? 
- Before joining grad school, I worked as a Data Analyst at an e-commerce mostly focusing on analyzing ad-hoc data. However, my work was rarely scalable and it was extremely difficult to process the growing numbers of data analytics needs and bulk of information. 
- So I recognized a clear need for me to learn how to manage a large volume of data in a scalable and efficient manner, so I joined Oregon State University to study database management systems. 
- At OSU, I've been working on developing efficient data cleaning solutions considering the data schema and properties of operating systems. 
- My team at the IDEA Lab primarily focuses on the efficient and effective data cleaning solution in the training data set for machne learnign algorithms, which resulted in a publication in SIGMOD 2020. 
- I'm looking to wrap up my graduate studies by December 2021 and before committing myself to a Ph.D. role, I wouuld love to explore conducting reserach in industry, so the opportunity at Microsoft would be an excellent learning experience for me. 

#### Why Microsoft? 
- Database research can be quite resource intensive, as the required computing power for processing a large volume (e.g., terra bytes) of data is non-trivial. 
- Researching in industry can be more flexible in that sense and I love that both teams at Microsoft consist of people from diverse backgrounds I can learn from. 
- Most notably, I follow some of the researchers at Microsoft from SIGMOD, the database management systems conference I published in. 
- For example, "Active Learning for ML Enhanced Database Systems" written by Bailu Ding (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/05/hal_sigmod_cr.pdf) is quite relevant to my current research project in the sense that the aim is to reduce the amount of human labor required for pre-processing data for efficient data manipulation in machine learning. 
- Also, Microsoft is leading the innovation in database management systems by its impactful reseach outcomes and products, such as Database Engine Tuning Advisor(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/database-engine-tuning-advisor?view=sql-server-ver15) for query processing. 

#### What are you looking for from the call? 
- It would be a great pleasure to work with brillaint researchers at Microsoft and contribute to developing a novel algorithm for effiently and effectively hanlding noisy data. 
- Also, I am very interested in both software enigneering practices and research work, so I'm open to whichever role I can help with. 
- For Summer 20201, I have an internship offer from the same e-commerce company, this time as a Backend Engineering, since I'm very interested in scalable data processing, so I'll be working on transaction management of the servers to ensure the conssitency and quality of data on the platform. 
- However, after my graduation in December 2021, I would love to join a company where I can learn more about database applications and gain some research experinece. 
- To that end, Microsoft would make a perfect place to launch my career!


--------------------------------------------
Notes during the interview: 

- 20 researchers in a team
- Potential roles: researcher within analytics, software engieer, applied scientist (data science + engineer)
- 4-6 people, over the course of week, 60 ~ 90 days, with the team itself (30 ~ 40 mminutes / technical), technical levels (60 ~ 75 minutes)

Q&A
- Mentorship 
- Performance assessment: not LOC / more individualized and holistic 

Follow-up
- Since the process usually takes up to 90 days, let's touchbase in fall to discuss in detail!
